# 📊 Machine Learning Insights: Data Exploration & Model Evaluation

This repository contains two complementary projects that focus on understanding and improving machine learning workflows from both **data** and **model** perspectives. Whether you're exploring high-dimensional datasets or trying to debug underfitting/overfitting, this toolkit provides hands-on examples, visualizations, and takeaways for every ML practitioner.

## 🔍 Overview

Understanding machine learning is more than just training a model — it's about:
- **Exploring your data** to uncover structure and reduce noise
- **Diagnosing model behavior** to adjust complexity and improve generalization

This repo includes:

1. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction and pattern discovery  
2. **Bias-Variance Analysis** to assess underfitting and overfitting using learning curves

## 📌 1. PCA: Data Visualization & Feature Insight

📄 File: `C3_W2_Lab01_PCA_Visualization_Examples.ipynb`

This notebook explores how **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** can:
- Project high-dimensional data into a 2D or 3D space for easier interpretation
- Capture the directions (principal components) of maximum variance in the data
- Reduce redundancy in features by removing correlations

### 🧠 What You'll Learn:
- The geometric interpretation of PCA (vectors, projections, variance)
- How to apply PCA for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Why not all projections are useful, and how PCA helps find the most informative ones
- Real-world PCA applications on synthetic and real datasets

### 📊 Visual Highlights:
- 2D and 3D scatter plots of transformed data
- Comparison of different projection axes
- Explained variance ratio plots

## 📌 2. Diagnosing Bias and Variance

📄 File: `Diagnosing bias and variance.ipynb`

This notebook walks through the process of identifying **model errors** using **training and cross-validation sets**. You'll simulate both high-bias (underfitting) and high-variance (overfitting) models using polynomial regression.

### 🧠 What You'll Learn:
- How to evaluate model performance on unseen data
- How training vs. validation error reveals overfitting or underfitting
- The role of model complexity in learning
- How to use learning curves to select the right model or training set size

### 📊 Visual Highlights:
- Learning curves for low vs. high complexity models
- Polynomial fit comparisons
- Error trend analysis to guide model tuning
